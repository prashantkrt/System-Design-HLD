# Monolithic Architecture

## 🧱 What is Monolithic Architecture?

A **monolithic architecture** is a software design pattern where all components of an application are packaged and deployed together as a single unit.

> Think of it as a "one big application" that handles everything — UI, business logic, data access, etc.

---

## 🏗️ Structure

- A single codebase
- Shared memory space
- Usually deployed as a `.war` or `.jar` (Java) or a single binary (Go, C#)
- Often uses a layered approach: Controller ➝ Service ➝ DAO


---

## ✅ Pros of Monolithic Architecture

- Simple to develop (especially for small teams)
- Easy to test end-to-end
- Straightforward deployment
- Fewer cross-cutting concerns (e.g., service discovery, inter-service communication)
- Easier to manage transactions that span multiple components
- Centralized logging and monitoring is simpler
- Less operational overhead (no need for complex DevOps setup)
- Well-suited for applications with tightly bound components
- Ideal for quick prototyping and MVPs
- Easier to debug due to single codebase
- Performance can be better due to in-process communication
- Easier IDE support and navigation (everything in one place)
- In Monolitic archtecture, all the modules are present in the single system, so they require     fewer netwrok calls as compared to other archtecture.
- It is comparatively easier to secure monolitic system.
- Integration testing is easier 
- Less confusion.

## ❌ Cons of Monolithic Architecture

### 🔧 Maintainability & Complexity
- Difficult to manage as the codebase grows (harder for new developers)
- Tight coupling between components makes refactoring risky
- Changes in one area may require testing and redeploying the entire app
- Slower development velocity in large teams due to merge conflicts and shared code

### 🚀 Deployment & Scalability
- Hard to scale independently (all or nothing)
- Risky deployments: one bug can affect the entire application
- Longer build and startup time
- No support for independent deployment of features or services
- Difficult to adopt different tech stacks for specific components

### 🧱 Architecture Limitations
- Everything bundled together = tightly coupled
- One failure affects all = shared risk
- Hard to scale or isolate = limited flexibility
- Limited reusability of components in other applications
- Poor fault isolation (e.g., memory leak in one part can crash the whole app)

### 🧪 Testing & CI/CD
- Regression testing becomes slower and more complicated
- Difficult to introduce CI/CD without affecting the whole monolith

### 🌍 Operational Concerns
- Less suitable for distributed teams or cross-functional squads
- Doesn't align well with modern DevOps and cloud-native patterns

## 🌍 Real-World Analogy

> Think of a **monolithic architecture like a big shopping mall** — everything is under one roof: clothing, food, electronics, and services. It’s convenient at first, but if one major issue like a power outage or fire occurs, the entire mall is affected. Also, it’s harder to expand or renovate a single store without disrupting others.

---

## 🧠 When to Use Monolithic Architecture

- ✅ MVP or prototype phase
- ✅ Small team or project
- ✅ Simple domain logic
- ✅ No requirement for independent scaling of modules

---

## 🔁 When to Move to Microservices

- 📈 You need to scale different modules independently  
  e.g., user service might need more instances than product service
- 👥 Your team grows and wants independent deployability
- 🔒 You want to isolate failures between components
- 🚀 You need faster iteration for individual features or teams
- 🧩 You want tech stack flexibility across modules

A Spring Boot application where everything is in one project:

# 🧱 Monolithic Architecture Design

All components are tightly coupled into a single deployable unit.

# 🔁 Deployment
- All modules are built and deployed as a single `.jar` or `.war` file.

### ⚠️ In Short drawbacks
- Tightly coupled components
- Difficult to scale independently
- One failure can impact the whole system
- Slower development and deployment cycles
- Monolithic architectures typically restrict the use of multiple programming languages.
- All modules must share the same language/runtime environment, limiting flexibility and innovation.
- You are limited to one programming language or tech stack across the entire system.

**Single Point of Failure**
   - All modules are combined in a single system.
   - If there is a bug or error in even one module, it can crash the entire application.

**Tightly Coupled Deployment**
   - Whenever a single module is updated, the entire system must be rebuilt and redeployed.
   - All modules are interconnected, so changes cannot be deployed in isolation.

**Framework or Language Dependency**
   - Any change in a single module’s **programming language** or **framework** affects the whole application.
   - Due to interlinking, adapting new technologies becomes difficult.
   - Even minor upgrades may require system-wide changes.
